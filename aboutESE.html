                    The logo of the Emirates Schools Establishment “Ta’leem”, meaning “Education” in Arabic and written
                    «تعليم», reflects the main pillar of what we do to educate our students in all public schools,
                    aiming at
                    refining and shaping their skills and knowledge and encouraging them to a culture of lifelong
                    learning.
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The logo is a combination of the powerful effect of “the seal” and how we are going to positively impact
                our
                students, and the importance of “writing”, being one of the most prominent means of communication. The
                logo
                also resembles the significance of preserving our ancestors’ legacy and passing on the science and
                knowledge... Without it, we would have not reached where we are... And through it, we will lay out the
                features of a brighter and more creative future.
